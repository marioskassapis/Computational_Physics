These Python Notebooks are the work done during the Computational Physics course at Imperial College London during Year 3 of MSci Physics degree.

The Assignment is a shorter type of project, which includes mini tasks that are completed directly as the notebook flows.

The Project is the file called "Main_Script" and concerns modelling quantum mechanical wavefunctions. Towards the bottom, a detailed analysis is done within the Notebooks and markdowns and comments serve to facilitate its use to the user.
