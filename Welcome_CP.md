## **Computational Physics 2018-19**

**Introduction**

This repository includes the work done as part of the Computational Physics course at Imperial College London, as part of the MSci Physics degree (Year 3). 

**Assignment**

The assignment was done on a Jupyter Notebook, with each Task clearly annotated with comments and markdowns  in the file. 

**Project: Solving Quantum Systems Numerically**

The project involved using numerical integration and Monte Carlo methods to reconstruct and solve the quantum system. 

Within the notebook, the tasks are clearly annotated with markdowns. Towards the end of it, an analysis of the techniques used is provided (in the same Notebook).
